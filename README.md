# My Portfolio
## Description
- This being the second iteration of my developer portfolio, I have updated it to reflect some of the actual work and projects I have worked on thus far.
- The purpose of this is to begin to showcase my abilities and work through a centralized location so that potential employers can view what I have worked on so far.
- As I continue to learn and develop additional skills, I will be able to schowcase them here on this page as well as provide links to projects that have particular emphasis on certain facets of development.
