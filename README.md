# My Portfolio
## Description
- The scope of this assignment was to build a web page from scratch that will serve as our Portfolio page.
- I have built this project to showcase my abilities to write and stylize a web page from the ground up and also create a page to showcase my current, completed works.
- I ran into many issues during the construction of this page, but through diligent research, have managed to overcome most of them, namely, FLexbox.  
- Through this assignment I have learned better practices for nesting flexbox as well many techniques to make a page more appealing and dynamic.
